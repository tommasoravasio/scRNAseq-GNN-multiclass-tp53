# scRNAseq-GNN-multiclass-tp53

## Project Overview
This repository implements a multiclass classification pipeline for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), with a particular focus on the TP53 gene. The project leverages advanced graph-based machine learning techniques to classify cellular states or mutations, providing a robust framework for biological data analysis.

## Background & Motivation
This project is a direct continuation of my previous work on binary classification of scRNAseq data using GNNs ([link to previous repo coming soon]). Building on that foundation, this repository extends the approach to multiclass problems, addressing more complex biological questions and demonstrating the scalability of graph-based models in genomics.

## Key Features
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** Utilizes state-of-the-art GNN architectures for modeling relationships between cells based on gene expression profiles.
- **Multiclass Classification:** Moves beyond binary outcomes to handle multiple cellular states or mutation classes, with a focus on TP53 status.
- **Reproducible ML Pipeline:** Modular scripts and configuration files for data preprocessing, graph construction, model training, and evaluation.
- **Custom Data Processing:** Includes tools for generating expression matrices, adding mutation status, and merging datasets.
- **Experiment Tracking:** Supports logging and comparison of different model runs and hyperparameters.

## Why This Project is Interesting
- **Technical Depth:** Demonstrates proficiency in advanced machine learning (GNNs, multiclass classification) and bioinformatics data processing.
- **End-to-End Pipeline:** Covers the full ML workflow, from raw data to model evaluation and result interpretation.
- **Research Relevance:** Tackles real-world biological questions, showing the application of ML to genomics and precision medicine.
- **Reproducibility & Modularity:** Designed for easy extension and adaptation to new datasets or research questions.

## Usage
*Instructions for running the pipeline, installing dependencies, and reproducing results will be added here.*
